# Introduction

Based on the series GSE152418 of 17 healthy vs. 17 COVID patient bulk RNA-Seq samples, a list of ranked genes by their log fold change was obtained after normalization by edgeR [@edgeR]. Previously, a thresholded gene set enrichment analysis using g:Profiler [@gprofiler] was performed. Here we compare the pathways found significant by g:Profiler with the results of a non-thresholded method GSEA.

# Non-thresholded GSEA

1. What method did you use? What genesets did you use? Make sure to specify versions and cite your methods.

We used GSEA [@gsea1, @gsea2] with the following parameters:
* Number of permutations: 1000
* Max size: 250
* Min size: 15
* Version: 4.1.0

We used the Human GO Biological Pathways geneset curated by Bader Lab on March 1, 2021, obtained [here](http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/March_01_2021/Human/symbol/) [@bader_genesets]. 

2. Summarize your enrichment results.

Ten times more genesets were significantly upregulated than downregulated in COVID samples (401/4996 vs. 43/4996). As expected, viral mRNA translation was upregulated in COVID samples. The immune system-related upregulated pathways in COVID samples include humoral immune response, adaptive immune response, immunoglobulin-mediated immune response. Pathways relevant to the [@arunachalam2020systems] paper were found to be significantly upregulated: hallmark interferon alpha response, defense response to bacterium, regulation of acute inflammatory response, and hallmark MTORC1 signalling. All pathways listed above have FDR < 0.01. 

3. How do these results compare to the results from the thresholded analysis in Assignment #2. Compare qualitatively. Is this a straight forward comparison? Why or why not?

In the thresholded analysis using g:Profiler, interferon alpha response was not found, where it was found to be significant in GSEA. This pathway was analyzed in the original [@arunachalam2020systems] paper for the data. The Fc-gamma receptor signalling pathway was significant in both g:Profiler and GSEA (FDR = 0.026). Both methods found immune response pathways to be upregulated in COVID samples. Qualitatively GSEA was able to find more genesets which [@arunachalam2020systems] found. This makes sense because they used non-thresholded instead of thresholded enrichment analysis [see code](https://github.com/scottmk777/COVID/blob/master/helper_setEnrichment.R). However the comparison is not straight-forward. Both tools are meant to provide an exploratory view of the data for further analysis, not to draw conclusions.

# Cytoscape Visualization

Create an enrichment map - how many nodes and how many edges in the resulting map? What thresholds were used to create this map? Make sure to record all thresholds. Include a screenshot of your network prior to manual layout.

18,727 nodes and 1,268,683 edges. The following thresholds were used:
* FDR q-value cutoff: 0.05
* p-value cutoff: 1.0
* Metric: Jaccard+Overlap cutoff at 0.5 for sparser graph

If using figures create a figures directory in your repo and make sure all references to the figures are relative in your Rmarkdown notebook.

# Interpretation

Do the enrichment results support conclusions or mechanism discussed in the original paper? How do these results differ from the results you got from Assignment #2 thresholded methods

Yes, the pathways found to be significant in [@arunachalam2020systems] were also found to be significant in non-thresholded GSEA. One difference is that Interferon-alpha production was found to be suppressed in [@arunachalam2020systems] but was found to be upregulated in GSEA. We will investigate this further in the next section.


## mTOR Pathway

Choose a specific pathway or theme to investigate in more detail. Why did you choose this pathway or theme? Show the pathway or theme as a gene network or as a pathway diagram. Annotate the network or pathway with your original log fold expression values and p-values to show how it is effected in your model. 

The [mTOR signaling pathway (WP1471)](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP1471) was found by [@arunachalam2020systems] to be significantly downregulated in COVID samples. However, annotation of the WikiPathway using the log fold-change of the ranked gene list does not reproduce their observation. This pathway was not found to be significant in GSEA's results.

![mTOR Pathway Annotated](mtor.png)

Interestingly mTOR is short for Mammalian target of Rapamycin, a drug that may be repurposed for treating COVID-19 symptoms [@husain2020rapamycin]. Rapamycin's action inhibits the mTOR signaling pathway, which would agree with the overexpression of some genes in COVID samples of the pathway shown in the figure above.
